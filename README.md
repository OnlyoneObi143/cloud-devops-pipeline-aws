# cloud-devops-pipeline-aws Project

This is **Phase 1-5** of my personal project demonstrating how to build and deploy a containerized Node.js application using GitLab CI/CD and AWS services like ECS, ECR, and CloudWatch. It simulates a real-world DevOps pipeline and showcases skills relevant to both DevOps and Cloud Engineering roles.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js + Express
- GitLab + GitHub
- Docker, ECS, ECR, CloudWatch
- Terraform, GitLab CI/CD


## Phase 1 Summary
âœ… Local development environment setup  
âœ… Node.js backend built and tested locally  
âœ… Code versioned on GitLab and GitHub

## Phase 2 Summary
âœ… Dockerfile created to containerize the Node.js app  
âœ… Image built and tested locally using Docker  
âœ… Docker image tagged and pushed to AWS ECR  
âœ… Updated project status pushed to GitHub and GitLab

## Phase 3 Summary
âœ… ECS Cluster and Fargate task definition created using Terraform  
âœ… IAM role configured for task execution  
âœ… Deployed Node.js container to ECS Fargate  
âœ… Application running publicly on assigned IP via AWS infrastructure

## Phase 4 Summary
âœ… Automated CI/CD pipeline created using GitLab  
âœ… Docker image built on commit and pushed to GitLab Container Registry  
âœ… ECS service updated automatically via GitLab pipeline using AWS CLI  

## Phase 5 Summary
âœ… Integrated AWS CloudWatch to monitor custom application metrics  
âœ… Implemented `RequestsPerMinute` metric in Node.js using AWS SDK  
âœ… Metrics published and visualized in real-time on a custom CloudWatch graph  
âœ… IAM roles and permissions configured to allow secure metric publishing from ECS tasks
