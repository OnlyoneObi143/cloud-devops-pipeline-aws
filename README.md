# cloud-devops-pipeline-aws Project

This is **Phase 1-3** of my personal project demonstrating how to build and deploy a containerized Node.js application using GitLab CI/CD and AWS services like ECS, ECR, and CloudWatch. It simulates a real-world DevOps pipeline and showcases skills relevant to both DevOps and Cloud Engineering roles.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js + Express
- GitLab + GitHub
- Docker, ECS, ECR (coming soon)

## Phase 1 Summary
✅ Local development environment setup  
✅ Node.js backend built and tested locally  
✅ Code versioned on GitLab and GitHub

## Phase 2 Summary
✅ Dockerfile created to containerize the Node.js app  
✅ Image built and tested locally using Docker  
✅ Docker image tagged and pushed to AWS ECR  
✅ Updated project status pushed to GitHub and GitLab

## Phase 3 Summary
✅ ECS Cluster and Fargate task definition created using Terraform  
✅ IAM role configured for task execution  
✅ Deployed Node.js container to ECS Fargate  
✅ Application running publicly on assigned IP via AWS infrastructure 

# Triggered CI/CD - Phase 4 test
